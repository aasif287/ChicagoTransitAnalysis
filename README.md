## Analysis of Public Transit Ridership Data

### Chicago 'L' Station Entries - Daily Totals

#### Dataset Source
The dataset used for this analysis is obtained from the Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) website: [CTA Data](https://www.transitchicago.com/data/). Specifically, the dataset is named "Ridership - 'L' Station Entries - Daily Totals."

#### Project Overview

This project involves analyzing two public transit datasets - one from Chicago and the other from San Francisco (BART). The primary goal is to extract meaningful insights regarding station boardings, busiest days, and least busy weekdays over a specified time frame.

### Chicago Analysis

1. **Busiest Station in Chicago**
   - The objective is to identify the busiest 'L' station in Chicago based on the highest number of boardings.

2. **Busiest Day in 20 Years**
   - Determining the day with the maximum ridership over the 20-year period for Chicago's 'L' stations.

3. **Least Busy Weekday**
   - Identifying the least busy weekday in terms of station boardings in Chicago.

4. **Explanation for Busiest and Least Busy Days**
   - A brief explanation of events or trends in Chicago on the busiest and least busy days.

### San Francisco BART Ridership Data Analysis

#### Dataset Source
The BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) ridership data is obtained from the official BART website: [BART Ridership Reports](https://www.bart.gov/about/reports/ridership).

#### Identifying Busiest Hours

This part of the project involves analyzing BART ridership data to determine the busiest hours, considering factors such as day, hour, source, destination, and count of passengers.
